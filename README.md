TabMover
========

IntelliJ Idea plugin with which you can move and rearrange Editor tabs (even between different IntelliJ windows on multiple monitors).


Default shortcuts, but I recommend checking them with your current keymap:

- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+Left</i> to move tab left;
- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+Right</i> to move tab right;
- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+Up</i> to make tab first;
- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+Down</i> to make tab last;
- <i>no default keystroke</i> to move tab to previous splitter (tabgroup) within the same window;
- <i>no default keystroke</i> to make tab to next splitter (tabgroup) within the same window;
- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+PageUp</i> to move tab to previous splitter or window (depending on which comes first);
- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+PageDown</i> to make tab to next splitter or window (depending on which comes first);
- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+OpenBracket</i> to focus previous splitter or window (depending on which comes first);
- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+CloseBracket</i> to focus next splitter or window (depending on which comes first);
- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+D</i> to open a new window with the current tab;
- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+P,P</i> to move all pinned tabs to the beginning of the tablist;
- <i>Control+Alt+Shift+P,T</i> to pin all tabs that are not pinned. Or if all tabs are pinned, unpin all;
- <i>Alt+Shift+T</i> show action popup with possible actions;

The plugin is open source (LGPL).

If you find this plugin useful, please consider inviting me for a beer.
I develop this plugin in my free time and I'm more motivated when I have a beer on desk :-)
